## Overview

Refer to the documentation for [using][book] and [developing][devbook] the Glean SDK.

For an overview of Glean beyond just the SDK, see the [section in the Firefox data docs](https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/concepts/glean/glean.html).

The code in this repository is organized as follows:

* [./glean-core/](glean-core) contains the source for the low-level Rust library.
* [./glean-core/ffi](glean-core/ffi) contains the mapping into a C FFI.
* [./glean-core/android](glean-core/android) contains the Kotlin bindings for use by Android applications.
* [./glean-core/ios](glean-core/ios) contains the Swift bindings for use by iOS applications.
* [./glean-core/python](glean-core/python) contains Python bindings.

**Note: The Glean SDK requires at least [Rust 1.53.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/06/17/Rust-1.53.0.html). Older versions are untested.**
