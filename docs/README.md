_Modern telemetry for mobile platforms_

The `Glean SDK` is a modern approach for a mobile Telemetry library and is part of the [Glean project](https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/concepts/glean/glean.html).
It started out as an [android-components library](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/tree/master/components/service/glean), written purely in Kotlin to be used on Android.

The `Glean SDK` is a work-in-progress to transform the concepts behind the `Glean SDK` into a cross-platform library based on a low-level [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) library and the necessary platform integrations for Android and iOS (and beyond...).

**Note: The cross-platform `Glean SDK` project is in development. It's not finished, and not used. Some of this documentation refers to features that were implemented in an earlier Android-specific version of the Glean SDK, but are not yet implemented in this version.**
