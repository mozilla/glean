# Glean SDK

![Glean logo](glean.jpeg)

The `Glean SDK` is a modern approach for a Telemetry library and is part of the [Glean project](https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/concepts/glean/glean.html).

There are currently two independent implementations of the Glean SDK, both sharing the documentation here:

- An Android-only implementation in [android-components](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/tree/master/components/service/glean).
- A [cross-platform implementation](https://github.com/mozilla/glean/).  (This implementation is currently under development and not ready for use).

To contact us you can:
- Find us on the Mozilla Slack in *#glean*, on [Mozilla IRC](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC) in *#telemetry*.
