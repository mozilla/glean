# glean.rs

_Modern Firefox Telemetry for mobile platforms_

`glean` is a modern approach for a mobile Telemetry library.
It started out as an [android-components library](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/tree/master/components/service/glean), written purely in Kotlin to be used on Android.

`glean.rs` is an experiment to transform `glean` into a cross-platform library based on a low-level [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) library and the necessary platform integrations for Android and iOS.

**Note: `glean.rs` is in development. It's not finished, not used and not documented yet.**
