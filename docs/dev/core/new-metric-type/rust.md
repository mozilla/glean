# Adding a new metric type - Rust

## Trait

To ensure the API is stable across Rust consumers and re-exporters (like FOG),
you must define a Trait for the new metric in `glean-core/src/traits`.
First, add your metric type to `mod.rs`:

```rust
mod counter;
...
pub use self::counter::Counter;
```

Then add the trait in e.g. `counter.rs`:

```rust
use crate::ErrorType;

/// A description for the [`CounterMetric`](crate::metrics::CounterMetric) type.
///
/// When changing this trait, make sure all the operations are
/// implemented in the related type in `../metrics/`.
pub trait Counter {
    /// Increases the counter by `amount`.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `amount` - The amount to increase by. Should be positive.
    ///
    /// ## Notes
    ///
    /// Logs an error if the `amount` is 0 or negative.
    fn add(&self, amount: i32);

    /// **Exported for test purposes.**
    ///
    /// Gets the currently stored value as an integer.
    ///
    /// This doesn't clear the stored value.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `ping_name` - represents the optional name of the ping to retrieve the
    ///   metric for. Defaults to the first value in `send_in_pings`.
    fn test_get_value<'a, S: Into<Option<&'a str>>>(&self, ping_name: S) -> Option<i32>;

    /// **Exported for test purposes.**
    ///
    /// Gets the number of recorded errors for the given metric and error type.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `error` - The type of error
    /// * `ping_name` - represents the optional name of the ping to retrieve the
    ///   metric for. Defaults to the first value in `send_in_pings`.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// The number of errors reported.
    fn test_get_num_recorded_errors<'a, S: Into<Option<&'a str>>>(
        &self,
        error: ErrorType,
        ping_name: S,
    ) -> i32;
}
```

Note the inclusion of any metric operation included in the metric type's API
(except `new`), and the addition of `test_get_num_recorded_errors`.
The idea here is to only include operations that make sense for Rust consumers.
If there are internal-only or language-specific APIs on the underlying metric,
feel free to not include them on the trait.

Spend some time on the comments.
These will be the dev-facing API docs for Rust consumers.

## Rust Language Binding (RLB) Type

The Rust Language Binding supplies the implementation of the trait
(mostly by delegating to the the glean-core implementation)
and adds a layer of ordering and safety using the dispatcher.
You can find the RLB metric implementations in
`glean-core/rlb/src/private`.

First, add your metric type to `mod.rs`:

```rust
mod counter;
...
pub use counter::Counter;
```

Then add the trait in e.g. `counter.rs`:

```rust
// This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public
// License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
// file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

use glean_core::Glean;
use inherent::inherent;
use std::sync::Arc;

use glean_core::metrics::MetricType;
use glean_core::ErrorType;

use crate::dispatcher;

// We need to wrap the glean-core type: otherwise if we try to implement
// the trait for the metric in `glean_core::metrics` we hit error[E0117]:
// only traits defined in the current crate can be implemented for arbitrary
// types.

/// Developer-facing API for recording counter metrics.
///
/// Instances of this class type are automatically generated by the parsers
/// at build time, allowing developers to record values that were previously
/// registered in the metrics.yaml file.
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct CounterMetric(pub(crate) Arc<glean_core::metrics::CounterMetric>);

impl CounterMetric {
    /// The public constructor used by automatically generated metrics.
    pub fn new(meta: glean_core::CommonMetricData) -> Self {
        Self(Arc::new(glean_core::metrics::CounterMetric::new(meta)))
    }

    /// Internal only, synchronous API for incremeting a counter
    pub(crate) fn add_sync(&self, glean: &Glean, amount: i32) {
        self.0.add(glean, amount);
    }
}

#[inherent(pub)]
impl glean_core::traits::Counter for CounterMetric {
    fn add(&self, amount: i32) {
        let metric = Arc::clone(&self.0);
        dispatcher::launch(move || crate::with_glean(|glean| metric.add(glean, amount)));
    }

    fn test_get_value<'a, S: Into<Option<&'a str>>>(&self, ping_name: S) -> Option<i32> {
        crate::block_on_dispatcher();

        let queried_ping_name = ping_name
            .into()
            .unwrap_or_else(|| &self.0.meta().send_in_pings[0]);

        crate::with_glean(|glean| self.0.test_get_value(glean, queried_ping_name))
    }

    fn test_get_num_recorded_errors<'a, S: Into<Option<&'a str>>>(
        &self,
        error: ErrorType,
        ping_name: S,
    ) -> i32 {
        crate::block_on_dispatcher();

        crate::with_glean_mut(|glean| {
            glean_core::test_get_num_recorded_errors(&glean, self.0.meta(), error, ping_name.into())
                .unwrap_or(0)
        })
    }
}
```

Note `new` and `add_sync` aren't on the trait.

Note there are no API comments on the trait's `impl`.

If your metric type has locked internal mutability,
(like `TimingDistributionMetric`'s `RwLock`)
you must always take the metric lock and Glean in the same order.

## Tests

Add at least a "smoke test" (a simple confirmation of the API's behaviour)
to the RLB implementation.

## Documentation

Don't forget to document the new Metric Type in the Book.
