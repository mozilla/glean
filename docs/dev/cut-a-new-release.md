# Glean release process

The Glean SDK consists of multiple libraries for different platforms and targets.
The main supported libraries are released as one.
Development happens on the main repository <https://github.com/mozilla/glean>.
See [Contributing](contributing.md) for how to contribute changes to the Glean SDK.

The development & release process roughly follows the [GitFlow model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

> **Note:** The rest of this section assumes that `upstream` points to the `https://github.com/mozilla/glean` repository,
> while `origin` points to the developer fork.
> For some developer workflows, `upstream` can be the same as `origin`.

## Published artifacts

* The Kotlin libraries are published to [Mozilla Maven](https://maven.mozilla.org/?prefix=maven2/org/mozilla/telemetry/).
* Python bindings are published on PyPI: [glean-sdk](https://pypi.org/project/glean-sdk/).
* Swift package available as [mozilla/glean-swift](https://github.com/mozilla/glean-swift).
* Rust crates are published on crates.io: [glean](https://crates.io/crates/glean), [glean-core](https://crates.io/crates/glean-core), [glean-ffi](https://crates.io/crates/glean-ffi).

## Standard Release

Releases can only be done by one of the Glean maintainers.

* Main development branch: `main`
* Main release branch: `release`
* Specific release branch: `release-vX.Y.Z`
* Hotfix branch: `hotfix-X.Y.(Z+1)`

### Create a release branch

1. Create a release branch from the `main` branch:
    ```
    git checkout -b release-v25.0.0 main
    ```
2. Update the changelog .
    1. Add any missing important changes under the `Unreleased changes` headline.
    2. Commit any changes to the changelog file due to the previous step.
3. Run `bin/prepare-release.sh <new version>` to bump the version number.
    1. The new version should be the next patch, minor or major version of what is currently released.
    2. Let it create a commit for you.
4. Push the new release branch:
    ```
    git push upstream release-v25.0.0
    ```
5. Wait for CI to finish on that branch and ensure it's green:
    * <https://circleci.com/gh/mozilla/glean/tree/release-v25.0.0>
    * You can find the TaskCluster task on the corresponding commit. See [How to find TaskCluster tasks](ci.md#how-to-find-taskcluster-tasks) for details.
6. Apply additional commits for bug fixes to this branch.
    * Adding large new features here is strictly prohibited. They need to go to the `main` branch and wait for the next release.

### Finish a release branch

When CI has finished and is green for your specific release branch, you are ready to cut a release.

1. Check out the main release branch:
    ```
    git checkout release
    ```
2. Merge the specific release branch:
    ```
    git merge --no-ff release-v25.0.0
    ```
3. Push the main release branch:
    ```
    git push upstream release
    ```
4. Tag the release on GitHub:
    1. [Draft a New Release](https://github.com/mozilla/glean/releases/new) in the GitHub UI (`Releases > Draft a New Release`).
    2. Enter `v<myversion>` as the tag. It's important this is the same as the version you specified to the `prepare_release.sh` script, with the `v` prefix added.
    3. Select the `release` branch as the target.
     4. Under the description, paste the contents of the release notes from `CHANGELOG.md`.
5. Wait for the CI build to complete for the tag.
    * You can check [on CircleCI for the running build](https://circleci.com/gh/mozilla/glean).
    * You can find the TaskCluster task on the corresponding commit. See [How to find TaskCluster tasks](ci.md#how-to-find-taskcluster-tasks) for details.
6. Send a pull request to merge back the specific release branch to the development branch: <https://github.com/mozilla/glean/compare/main...release-v25.0.0?expand=1>
    * This is important so that no changes are lost.
    * This might have merge conflicts with the `main` branch, which you need to fix before it is merged.
    * If this PR is "trivial" (no bugfixes or merge conflicts of note from earlier steps) you may land it without review.
7. Once the above pull request lands, delete the specific release branch.
8. Update `glean-ffi` in the iOS megazord. See the [application-services documentation for that](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/blob/main/megazords/ios/README.md#glean-component).
9. Post a message to [#glean:mozilla.org](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#glean:mozilla.org) announcing the new release.
    * Include a copy of the release-specific changelog if you want to be fancy.

## Hotfix release for latest version

If the latest released version requires a bug fix, a hotfix branch is used.

### Create a hotfix branch

1. Create a hotfix branch from the main release branch:
    ```
    git checkout -b hotfix-v25.0.1 release
    ```
3. Run `bin/prepare-release.sh <new version>` to bump the version number.
    1. The new version should be the next patch version of what is currently released.
    2. Let it create a commit for you.
4. Push the hotfix branch:
    ```
    git push upstream hotfix-v25.0.1
    ```
5. Create a local hotfix branch for bugfixes:
    ```
    git checkout -b bugfix hotfix-v25.0.1
    ```
5. Fix the bug and commit the fix in one or more separate commits.
6. Push your bug fixes and create a pull request against the hotfix branch: <https://github.com/mozilla/glean/compare/hotfix-v25.0.1...your-name:bugfix?expand=1>
7. When that pull request lands, wait for CI to finish on that branch and ensure it's green:
    * <https://circleci.com/gh/mozilla/glean/tree/hotfix-v25.0.1>
    * You can find the TaskCluster task on the corresponding commit. See [How to find TaskCluster tasks](ci.md#how-to-find-taskcluster-tasks) for details.

### Finish a hotfix branch

When CI has finished and is green for your hotfix branch, you are ready to cut a release, similar to a normal release:

1. Check out the main release branch:
    ```
    git checkout release
    ```
2. Merge the hotfix branch:
    ```
    git merge --no-ff hotfix-v25.0.1
    ```
3. Push the main release branch:
    ```
    git push upstream release
    ```
4. Tag the release on GitHub:
    1. [Draft a New Release](https://github.com/mozilla/glean/releases/new) in the GitHub UI (`Releases > Draft a New Release`).
    2. Enter `v<myversion>` as the tag. It's important this is the same as the version you specified to the `prepare_release.sh` script, with the `v` prefix added.
    3. Select the `release` branch as the target.
    4. Under the description, paste the contents of the release notes from `CHANGELOG.md`.
5. Wait for the CI build to complete for the tag.
    * You can check [on CircleCI for the running build](https://circleci.com/gh/mozilla/glean).
    * You can find the TaskCluster task on the corresponding commit. See [How to find TaskCluster tasks](ci.md#how-to-find-taskcluster-tasks) for details.
6. Send a pull request to merge back the hotfix branch to the development branch: <https://github.com/mozilla/glean/compare/main...hotfix-v25.0.1?expand=1>
    * This is important so that no changes are lost.
    * This might have merge conflicts with the `main` branch, which you need to fix before it is merged.
7. Once the above pull request lands, delete the hotfix branch.
8. Update `glean-ffi` in the iOS megazord. See the [application-services documentation for that](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/blob/main/megazords/ios/README.md#glean-component).

## Hotfix release for previous version

If you need to release a hotfix for a previously released version (that is: not the latest released version), you need a support branch.

> **Note**: This should rarely happen. We generally support only the latest released version of Glean.

### Create a support and hotfix branch

1. Create a support branch from the version tag and push it:
    ```
    git checkout -b support/v24.0 v24.0.0
    git push upstream support/v24.0
    ```
2. Create a hotfix branch for this support branch:
    ```
    git checkout -b hotfix-v24.0.1 support/v24.0
    ```
3. Fix the bug and commit the fix in one or more separate commits into your hotfix branch.
4. Push your bug fixes and create a pull request against the support branch: <https://github.com/mozilla/glean/compare/support/v24.0...your-name:hotfix-v24.0.1?expand=1>
5. When that pull request lands, wait for CI to finish on that branch and ensure it's green:
    * <https://circleci.com/gh/mozilla/glean/tree/support/v24.0>
    * You can find the TaskCluster task on the corresponding commit. See [How to find TaskCluster tasks](ci.md#how-to-find-taskcluster-tasks) for details.

### Finish a support branch

1. Check out the support branch:
    ```
    git checkout support/v24.0
    ```
2. Update the changelog .
    1. Add any missing important changes under the `Unreleased changes` headline.
    2. Commit any changes to the changelog file due to the previous step.
3. Run `bin/prepare-release.sh <new version>` to bump the version number.
    1. The new version should be the next patch version of the support branch.
    2. Let it create a commit for you.
3. Push the support branch:
    ```
    git push upstream support/v24.0
    ```
4. Tag the release on GitHub:
    1. [Draft a New Release](https://github.com/mozilla/glean/releases/new) in the GitHub UI (`Releases > Draft a New Release`).
    2. Enter `v<myversion>` as the tag. It's important this is the same as the version you specified to the `prepare_release.sh` script, with the `v` prefix added.
    3. Select the support branch (e.g. `support/v24.0`) as the target.
    4. Under the description, paste the contents of the release notes from `CHANGELOG.md`.
5. Wait for the CI build to complete for the tag.
    * You can check [on CircleCI for the running build](https://circleci.com/gh/mozilla/glean).
    * You can find the TaskCluster task on the corresponding commit. See [How to find TaskCluster tasks](ci.md#how-to-find-taskcluster-tasks) for details.
6. Send a pull request to merge back any bug fixes to the development branch: <https://github.com/mozilla/glean/compare/main...support/v24.0?expand=1>
    * This is important so that no changes are lost.
    * This might have merge conflicts with the `main` branch, which you need to fix before it is merged.
7. Once the above pull request lands, delete the support branch.

## Upgrading android-components to a new version of Glean

On Android, Mozilla products consume the Glean SDK through its wrapper in [`android-components`](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components).
Therefore, when a new Glean SDK release is made, `android-components` must also be updated.

After following one of the above instructions to make a Glean SDK release:

1. Ensure that CI has completed and the artifacts are published on [Mozilla's Maven repository](https://maven.mozilla.org/?prefix=maven2/org/mozilla/telemetry/).

2. Create a pull request against `android-components` to update the Glean version with the following changes:

   - The Glean version is updated in the `mozilla_glean` variable in the [`buildSrc/src/main/java/Dependencies.kt`](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/blob/69546999739ab19d21425e9a98e107e438a3f905/buildSrc/src/main/java/Dependencies.kt#L32) file.

   - The relevant parts of the Glean changelog copied into the top part of the [`android-components` changelog](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/blob/main/docs/changelog.md).
     This involves copying the Android-specific changes and the general changes to Glean, but can omit other platform-specific changes.

**IMPORTANT:** Until the [Glean Gradle plugin work is complete](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1592947), all downstream consumers of android-components will also need to update their version of Glean to match the version used in android-components so that their unit tests can run correctly.

In Fenix, for example, the [Glean version is specified here](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/blob/5e4ef202b85e273cf46ec5c7ec1b80f30ca4e77c/buildSrc/src/main/java/Dependencies.kt#L44).
