# Introduction

Glean is a modern approach for a telemetry library
and is part of the [Glean project](https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/concepts/glean/glean.html).

![Glean logo](glean.jpeg)

There are two implementations of Glean, with support for 5 different programming languages in total.
Both implementations strive to contain the same features with similar, but idiomatic APIs.

Unless clearly stated otherwise, regard the text in this book as valid for both clients
and all the supported programming languages and environments.

### [The Glean SDK](https://github.com/mozilla/glean)

The Glean SDK is an implementation of Glean in Rust, with language bindings for **Kotlin**,
**Python**, **Rust** and **Swift**.

For development documentation on the `Glean SDK`,
refer to [the Glean SDK development book](../dev/index.html).

To report issues or request changes on the Glean SDK,
file a bug in [Bugzilla in Data Platform & Tools :: Glean: SDK](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Data+Platform+and+Tools&component=Glean%3A+SDK&priority=P3&status_whiteboard=%5Btelemetry%3Aglean-rs%3Am%3F%5D).

### [Glean.js](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js)

Glean.js is an implementation of Glean in **Javascript**. Currently, it only has support
for usage in web extensions.

For development documentation on `Glean.js`,
refer to [the Glean.js development documentation](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/tree/main/docs).

To report issues or request changes on Glean.js,
file a bug in [Bugzilla in Data Platform & Tools :: Glean.js][gleanjs-bugs].

> **Note** Glean.js is still in development and does not provide all the features the Glean SDK does.
> Feature parity will be worked on after initial validation. Do not hesitate to [file a bug][gleanjs-bugs]
> if you want to use Glean.js and is missing some key Glean feature.

Glean's built-in error reporting mechanism.

If you want to start using Glean to report data, this is the section you should read.

### [API Reference](./reference/yaml/index.html)

This section of the book contains reference pages for Glean’s user facing APIs.

If you are looking for information a specific Glean API, this is the section you should check out.
