## baseline

This is a built-in ping that is assembled out of the box by the Glean SDK.

See the Glean SDK documentation for the [`baseline` ping](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/baseline.html).

This ping includes the [client id](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section).

**Data reviews for this ping:**

- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1512938#c3>
- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1599877#c25>

**Bugs related to this ping:**

- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/1599877>

**Reasons this ping may be sent:**

- `background`: The ping was submitted before going to background.

- `dirty_startup`: The ping was submitted at startup, because the application process was
      killed before the Glean SDK had the chance to generate this ping, when
      going to background, in the last session.

      *Note*: this ping will not contain the `glean.baseline.duration` metric.


The following metrics are added to the ping:

| Name | Type | Description | Data reviews | Extras | Expiration |

| glean.baseline.duration |[timespan](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/timespan.html) |The duration of the last foreground session.  |[1](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1512938#c3)||never |
| glean.baseline.locale |[string](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/string.html) |The locale of the application (e.g. "es-ES"). If the locale can't be determined on the system, the value is "und", to indicate "undetermined".  |[1](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1512938#c3)||never |

## deletion-request

This ping is submitted when a user opts out of sending technical and interaction data to Mozilla. This ping is intended to communicate to the Data Pipeline that the user wishes to have their reported Telemetry data deleted. As such it attempts to send itself at the moment the user opts out of data collection.


This ping is sent if empty.

This ping includes the [client id](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section).

**Data reviews for this ping:**

**Bugs related to this ping:**
