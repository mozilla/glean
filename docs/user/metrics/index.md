# Metrics

There are different metrics to choose from, depending on what you want to achieve:

* [Events](event.md): Records events e.g. individual occurences of user actions, say every time a view was open and from where.

* [Boolean](boolean.md): Records a single truth value, for example "is a11y enabled?"

* [String](string.md): Records a single Unicode string value, for example the name of the OS.

* [String List](string_list.md): Records a list of Unicode string values, for example the list of enabled search engines.

* [Counter](counter.md): Used to count how often something happens, for example, how often a certain button was pressed.

* [Timespan](timespan.md): Used to measure how much time is spent in a single task.

* [Timing Distribution](timing_distribution.md): Used to record the distribution of multiple time measurements.

* [Datetime](datetime.md): Used to record an absolute date and time, such as the time the user first ran the application.

* [UUID](uuid.md): Used to record universally unique identifiers (UUIDs), such as a client ID.

* [Labeled Metrics](labeled_metric.md): Used to record multiple metrics of the same type under different string labels, say every time you want to get a count of different error types in one metric.
