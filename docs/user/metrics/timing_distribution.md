# Timing Distribution

**STATUS: [Not implemented.](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1552865)**

Timing distributions are used to accumulate and store time measurement, for analyzing distributions of the timing data.

To measure the distribution of multiple timespans, see [Timing Distributions](timing_distribution.md). To record absolute times, see [Datetimes](datetime.md).

## Configuration 

Timing distributions have a required `time_unit` parameter to specify the resolution and range of the values that are recorded. The allowed values for `time_unit` are:

  - `nanosecond`
  - `microsecond`
  - `millisecond`
  - `second`
  - `minute`
  - `hour`
  - `day`

Which range of values is recorded in detail depends on the `time_unit`, e.g. for milliseconds, all values greater 60000 are recorded as overflow values.

If you wanted to create a timing distribution to measure page load times, first you need to add an entry for it to the `metrics.yaml` file:

```YAML
pages:
  page_load:
    type: timing_distribution
    time_unit: millisecond
    description: >
      Counts how long each page takes to load
    ...
```

## API

Now you can use the timing distribution from the application's code. Each time interval that the timing distribution metric records must be associated with an object provided by the user. This is so that intervals can be measured concurrently.  For example, to measure page load time on a number of tabs that are loading at the same time, each time interval should be associated with an object that uniquely represents each tab.

```Kotlin
import org.mozilla.yourApplication.GleanMetrics.Pages

fun onPageStart(e: Event) {
    Pages.pageLoad.start(e.target)
}

fun onPageLoaded(e: Event) {
    Pages.pageLoad.stopAndAccumulate(e.target)
}
```

There are test APIs available too.  For convenience, properties `sum` and `count` are exposed to facilitate validating that data was recorded correctly.

Continuing the `pageLoad` example above, at this point the metric should have a `sum == 11` and a `count == 2`:

```Kotlin
import org.mozilla.yourApplication.GleanMetrics.Pages
Glean.enableTestingMode()

// Was anything recorded?
assertTrue(pages.pageLoad.testHasValue())

// Get snapshot
val snapshot = pages.pageLoad.testGetValue()

// Does the sum have the expected value?
assertEquals(11, snapshot.sum)

// Usually you don't know the exact timing values, but how many should have been recorded.
assertEquals(2L, snapshot.count())
```

## Limits

* Which range of values is recorded in detail depends on the `time_unit`, e.g. for milliseconds, all values greater 60000 are recorded as overflow values.
  
## Examples

* How long does it take a page to load?

## Recorded errors

* `invalid_value`: If recording a negative timespan.
