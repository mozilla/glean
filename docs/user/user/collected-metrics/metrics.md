# Metrics

This document enumerates the metrics collected by this project using the [Glean SDK](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/index.html).
This project may depend on other projects which also collect metrics.
This means you might have to go searching through the dependency tree to get a full picture of everything collected by this project.

# Pings

- [all-pings](#all-pings)
- [baseline](#baseline)
- [deletion-request](#deletion-request)
- [metrics](#metrics)

## all-pings

These metrics are sent in every ping.

All Glean pings contain built-in metrics in the [`ping_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-ping_info-section) and [`client_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section) sections.

In addition to those built-in metrics, the following metrics are added to the ping:

| Name | Type | Description | Data reviews | Extras | Expiration | [Data Sensitivity](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| glean.error.invalid_label |[labeled_counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/labeled_counters.html) |Counts the number of times a metric was set with an invalid label. The labels are the `category.name` identifier of the metric.  |[Bug 1499761](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1499761#c5)||never |1 |
| glean.error.invalid_overflow |[labeled_counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/labeled_counters.html) |Counts the number of times a metric was set a value that overflowed. The labels are the `category.name` identifier of the metric.  |[Bug 1591912](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1591912#c3)||never |1 |
| glean.error.invalid_state |[labeled_counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/labeled_counters.html) |Counts the number of times a timing metric was used incorrectly. The labels are the `category.name` identifier of the metric.  |[Bug 1499761](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1499761#c5)||never |1 |
| glean.error.invalid_value |[labeled_counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/labeled_counters.html) |Counts the number of times a metric was set to an invalid value. The labels are the `category.name` identifier of the metric.  |[Bug 1499761](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1499761#c5)||never |1 |
| glean.restarted |[event](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/event.html) |Recorded when the Glean SDK is restarted.  Only included in custom pings that record events.  For more information, please consult the [Custom Ping documentation](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/custom.html#the-gleanrestarted-event).  |[Bug 1716725](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1716725)||never |1 |

## baseline

This is a built-in ping that is assembled out of the box by the Glean SDK.

See the Glean SDK documentation for the [`baseline` ping](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/baseline.html).

This ping is sent if empty.

This ping includes the [client id](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section).

**Data reviews for this ping:**

- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1512938#c3>
- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1599877#c25>

**Bugs related to this ping:**

- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/1512938>
- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/1599877>

**Reasons this ping may be sent:**

- `active`: The ping was submitted when the application became active again, which
      includes when the application starts. In earlier versions, this was called
      `foreground`.

      *Note*: this ping will not contain the `glean.baseline.duration` metric.

- `dirty_startup`: The ping was submitted at startup, because the application process was
      killed before the Glean SDK had the chance to generate this ping, before
      becoming inactive, in the last session.

      *Note*: this ping will not contain the `glean.baseline.duration` metric.

- `inactive`: The ping was submitted when becoming inactive. In earlier versions, this
      was called `background`.


All Glean pings contain built-in metrics in the [`ping_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-ping_info-section) and [`client_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section) sections.

In addition to those built-in metrics, the following metrics are added to the ping:

| Name | Type | Description | Data reviews | Extras | Expiration | [Data Sensitivity](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| glean.baseline.duration |[timespan](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/timespan.html) |The duration of the last foreground session.  |[Bug 1512938](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1512938#c3)||never |1, 2 |
| glean.validation.pings_submitted |[labeled_counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/labeled_counters.html) |A count of the pings submitted, by ping type.  This metric appears in both the metrics and baseline pings.  - On the metrics ping, the counts include the number of pings sent since   the last metrics ping (including the last metrics ping) - On the baseline ping, the counts include the number of pings send since   the last baseline ping (including the last baseline ping)  |[Bug 1586764](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1586764#c3)||never |1 |

## deletion-request

This is a built-in ping that is assembled out of the box by the Glean SDK.

See the Glean SDK documentation for the [`deletion-request` ping](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/deletion-request.html).

This ping is sent if empty.

This ping includes the [client id](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section).

**Data reviews for this ping:**

- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1587095#c6>
- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1702622#c2>

**Bugs related to this ping:**

- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/1587095>
- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/1702622>

**Reasons this ping may be sent:**

- `at_init`: The ping was submitted at startup.
      Glean discovered that between the last time it was run and this time,
      upload of data has been disabled.

- `set_upload_enabled`: The ping was submitted between Glean init and Glean shutdown.
      Glean was told after init but before shutdown that upload has changed
      from enabled to disabled.


All Glean pings contain built-in metrics in the [`ping_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-ping_info-section) and [`client_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section) sections.

This ping contains no metrics.

## metrics

This is a built-in ping that is assembled out of the box by the Glean SDK.

See the Glean SDK documentation for the [`metrics` ping](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/metrics.html).

This ping includes the [client id](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section).

**Data reviews for this ping:**

- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1512938#c3>
- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1557048#c13>

**Bugs related to this ping:**

- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/1512938>

**Reasons this ping may be sent:**

- `overdue`: The last ping wasn't submitted on the current calendar day, but it's after
      4am, so this ping submitted immediately

- `reschedule`: A ping was just submitted. This ping was rescheduled for the next calendar
      day at 4am.

- `today`: The last ping wasn't submitted on the current calendar day, but it is
      still before 4am, so schedule to send this ping on the current calendar
      day at 4am.

- `tomorrow`: The last ping was already submitted on the current calendar day, so
      schedule this ping for the next calendar day at 4am.

- `upgrade`: This ping was submitted at startup because the application was just
      upgraded.


All Glean pings contain built-in metrics in the [`ping_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-ping_info-section) and [`client_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section) sections.

Since quota is only calculated for the pending pings directory, and deletion request ping live in a different directory, deletion request pings are never deleted.  |[Bug 1601550](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1601550#c3)||never |1 |
