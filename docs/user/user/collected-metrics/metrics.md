# Metrics

This document enumerates the metrics collected by this project using the [Glean SDK](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/index.html).
This project may depend on other projects which also collect metrics.
This means you might have to go searching through the dependency tree to get a full picture of everything collected by this project.

## all-pings

These metrics are sent in every ping.

All Glean pings contain built-in metrics in the [`ping_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-ping_info-section) and [`client_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section) sections.

In addition to those built-in metrics, the following metrics are added to the ping:

## baseline

This is a built-in ping that is assembled out of the box by the Glean SDK.

See the Glean SDK documentation for the [`baseline` ping](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/baseline.html).

This ping is sent if empty.

This ping includes the [client id](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section).

**Data reviews for this ping:**

- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1512938#c3>
- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1599877#c25>

**Bugs related to this ping:**

- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/1512938>
- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/1599877>

**Reasons this ping may be sent:**

- `active`: The ping was submitted when the application became active again, which
      includes when the application starts. In earlier versions, this was called
      `foreground`.

      *Note*: this ping will not contain the `glean.baseline.duration` metric.

- `dirty_startup`: The ping was submitted at startup, because the application process was
      killed before the Glean SDK had the chance to generate this ping, before
      becoming inactive, in the last session.

      *Note*: this ping will not contain the `glean.baseline.duration` metric.

- `inactive`: The ping was submitted when becoming inactive. In earlier versions, this
      was called `background`.


All Glean pings contain built-in metrics in the [`ping_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-ping_info-section) and [`client_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section) sections.

In addition to those built-in metrics, the following metrics are added to the ping:

| Name | Type | Description | Data reviews | Extras | Expiration | [Data Sensitivity](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| glean.baseline.duration |[timespan](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/timespan.html) |The duration of the last foreground session.  |[Bug 1512938](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1512938#c3)||never |1, 2 |
| glean.validation.pings_submitted |[labeled_counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/labeled_counters.html) |A count of the built-in pings submitted, by ping type.  This metric appears in both the metrics and baseline pings.  - On the metrics ping, the counts include the number of pings sent since   the last metrics ping (including the last metrics ping) - On the baseline ping, the counts include the number of pings send since   the last baseline ping (including the last baseline ping)  Note: Previously this also recorded the number of submitted custom pings. Now it only records counts for the Glean built-in pings.  |[Bug 1586764](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1586764#c3)||never |1 |

## deletion-request

This is a built-in ping that is assembled out of the box by the Glean SDK.

See the Glean SDK documentation for the [`deletion-request` ping](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/deletion-request.html).

This ping is sent if empty.

This ping includes the [client id](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section).

**Data reviews for this ping:**

- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1587095#c6>
- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1702622#c2>

**Bugs related to this ping:**

- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/1587095>
- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/1702622>

**Reasons this ping may be sent:**

- `at_init`: The ping was submitted at startup.
      Glean discovered that between the last time it was run and this time,
      upload of data has been disabled.

- `set_upload_enabled`: The ping was submitted between Glean init and Glean shutdown.
      Glean was told after init but before shutdown that upload has changed
      from enabled to disabled.


All Glean pings contain built-in metrics in the [`ping_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-ping_info-section) and [`client_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section) sections.

This ping contains no metrics.

## glean_internal_info

All Glean pings contain built-in metrics in the [`ping_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-ping_info-section) and [`client_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section) sections.

In addition to those built-in metrics, the following metrics are added to the ping:

## health

The purpose of the health ping is to transport all of the health
metric information. The `health` ping is automatically sent when the
application calls Glean initialize before any operations are done on
the data path with a reason of `pre_init`.


This ping includes the [client id](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section).

**Data reviews for this ping:**

- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1982711#c3>

**Bugs related to this ping:**

- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/1667815>
- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/1982711>

**Reasons this ping may be sent:**

- `pre_init`: The ping was submitted before Glean initialization with the state of
      Glean's data directories prior to rkv opening files on the data path.


All Glean pings contain built-in metrics in the [`ping_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-ping_info-section) and [`client_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section) sections.

Structure is an array of objects, each containing the following properties: - `dir_name`: The name of the directory. This is the subdirectory name relative to the   FOG data directory and should only include "db", "events", and "pending_pings". - `dir_exists`: Whether the directory exists. This should only be false on the first   run of FOG, or if the directory was deleted. - `dir_created`: The creation time of the directory, in seconds since the unix epoch. If   the directory does not exist, this will be `null` and if the time cannot be determined,   it will default to `0`. - `dir_modified`: The last modification time of the directory, in seconds since the unix   epoch. If the directory does not exist, this will be `null` and if the time cannot be   determined, it will default to `0`. - `file_count`: The number of files in the directory. If the directory does not exist,   this will be `0`. - `error_message`: If there was an error accessing the directory, this will contain a   brief description of the error. If there was no error, this will be null. - `files`: An array of objects, each containing:   - `file_name`: The name of the file. Could be `data.safe.bin`, `events.safe.bin`, or     A UUID representing the doc-id of a pending ping.   - `file_created`: The creation time of the file, in seconds since the epoch. If the     file does not exist, this will be `null` and if the time cannot be determined, it     will default to `0`.   - `file_modified`: The last modification time of the file, in seconds since the epoch.     If the file does not exist, this will be `null` and if the time cannot be determined,     it will default to `0`.   - `file_size`: The size of the file in bytes. This can be just about any size but a     `0` value indicates the file is empty.   - `error_message`: If there was an error accessing the file, this will contain a brief     description of the error. If there was no error, this will be null.  |[Bug 1982711](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1982711#c3)||never |1 |
| glean.upload.deleted_pings_after_quota_hit |[counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/counter.html) |The number of pings deleted after the quota for the size of the pending pings directory or number of files is hit. Since quota is only calculated for the pending pings directory, and deletion request ping live in a different directory, deletion request pings are never deleted.  |[Bug 1601550](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1601550#c3)||never |1 |
