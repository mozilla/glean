# The General API

The Glean SDK has a minimal API available on its top-level `Glean` object.
This API allows one to enable and disable upload, register [custom pings][custom-pings] and set [experiment data][experiments-api].

[custom-pings]: pings/custom.md
[experiments-api]: experiments-api.md

> **Important:** The Glean SDK should only be initialized from the main application, not individual libraries.

If you are adding Glean SDK support to a library, you can safely skip this section.

## The API

The Glean SDK provides a general API that supports the following operations. See below for language-specific details.

| Operation | Description | Notes |
| --------- | ----------- | ----- |
| `initialize` | Configure and initialize the Glean SDK. | [Initializing the Glean SDK](#initializing-the-glean-sdk) |
| `setUploadEnabled` | Enable or disable Glean collection and upload. | [Enabling and disabling Metrics](#enabling-and-disabling-metrics) |
| `registerPings` | Register custom pings generated from `pings.yaml`. | [Custom pings][custom-pings] |
| `setExperimentActive` | Indicate that an experiment is running. | [Using the Experiments API][experiments-api] |
| `setExperimentInactive` | Indicate that an experiment is no longer running.. | [Using the Experiments API][experiments-api] |

## Initializing the Glean SDK

The following steps are required for applications using the Glean SDK, but not libraries.

> **Note**: The `initialize` function _must_ be called, even if telemetry upload is disabled.
> Glean needs to perform maintenance tasks even when telemetry is disabled, and because Glean
> does this as part of its initialization, it is _required_ to always call the `initialize`
> function. Otherwise, Glean won't be able to clean up collected data, disable queuing of pre-init
> tasks, or perform other required operations.
>
> This does not apply to special builds where telemetry is disabled at build time. In that case, it is acceptable to not call `initialize` at all.

> **Note**: The Glean SDK does not support use across multiple processes, and must only be initialized on the application's main process. Initializing in other processes is a no-op.
> Additionally, Glean must be initialized on the main (UI) thread of the applications main process. Failure to do so will throw an `IllegalThreadStateException`.

An excellent place to initialize Glean is within the `onCreate` method of the class that extends Android's `Application` class.

```Kotlin
import org.mozilla.yourApplication.GleanMetrics.GleanBuildInfo
import org.mozilla.yourApplication.GleanMetrics.Pings

class SampleApplication : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        // If you have custom pings in your application, you must register them
        // using the following command. This command should be omitted for
        // applications not using custom pings.
        Glean.registerPings(Pings)

        // Initialize the Glean library.
        Glean.initialize(
            applicationContext,
            // Here, `settings()` is a method to get user preferences, specific to
            // your application and not part of the Glean SDK API.
            uploadEnabled = settings().isTelemetryEnabled,
            buildInfo = GleanBuildInfo.buildInfo
        )
    }
}
```

Once initialized, if `uploadEnabled` is true, the Glean SDK will automatically start collecting [baseline metrics](pings/metrics.md) and sending its [pings](pings/index.md), according to their respective schedules.
If `uploadEnabled` is false, any persisted metrics, events and pings (other than `first_run_date` and `first_run_hour`) are cleared, and subsequent calls to record metrics will be no-ops.

The Glean SDK should be initialized as soon as possible, and importantly, before any other libraries in the application start using Glean.
Library code should never call `Glean.initialize`, since it should be called exactly once per application.

> **Note**: if the application has the concept of release channels and knows which channel it is on at run-time, then it can provide the Glean SDK with this information by setting it as part of the `Configuration` object parameter of the `Glean.initialize` method. For example:

```Kotlin
Glean.initialize(
    applicationContext,
    uploadEnabled = setting().isTelemetryEnabled,
    configuration = Configuration(channel = "beta"),
    buildInfo = GleanBuildInfo.buildInfo
)
```

> **Note**: When the Glean SDK is consumed through Android Components, it is required to configure an HTTP client to be used for upload.
> For example:

```Kotlin
// Requires `org.mozilla.components:concept-fetch`
import mozilla.components.concept.fetch.Client
// Requires `org.mozilla.components:lib-fetch-httpurlconnection`.
// This can be replaced by other implementations, e.g. `lib-fetch-okhttp`
// or an implementation from `browser-engine-gecko`.
import mozilla.components.lib.fetch.httpurlconnection.HttpURLConnectionClient

import mozilla.components.service.glean.config.Configuration
import mozilla.components.service.glean.net.ConceptFetchHttpUploader

val httpClient = ConceptFetchHttpUploader(lazy { HttpURLConnectionClient() as Client })
val config = Configuration(httpClient = httpClient)
Glean.initialize(
    context,
    uploadEnabled = true,
    configuration = config,
    buildInfo = GleanBuildInfo.buildInfo
)
```

An excellent place to initialize Glean is within the `application(_:)` method of the class that extends the `UIApplicationDelegate` class.

```Swift
import Glean
import UIKit

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions _: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        // If you have custom pings in your application, you must register them
        // using the following command. This command should be omitted for
        // applications not using custom pings.
        Glean.shared.registerPings(GleanMetrics.Pings)

        // Initialize the Glean library.
        Glean.shared.initialize(
            // Here, `Settings` is a method to get user preferences specific to
            // your application, and not part of the Glean SDK API.
            uploadEnabled = Settings.isTelemetryEnabled
        )
    }
}
```

Once initialized, if `uploadEnabled` is true, the Glean SDK will automatically start collecting [baseline metrics](pings/metrics.md) and sending its [pings](pings/index.md), according to their respective schedules.
If `uploadEnabled` is false, any persisted metrics, events and pings (other than `first_run_date` and `first_run_hour`) are cleared, and subsequent calls to record metrics will be no-ops.

The Glean SDK should be initialized as soon as possible, and importantly, before any other libraries in the application start using Glean.
Library code should never call `Glean.shared.initialize`, since it should be called exactly once per application.

<div data-lang="Python" class="tab">

The main control for the Glean SDK is on the `glean.Glean` singleton.

The Glean SDK should be initialized as soon as possible, and importantly, before any other libraries in the application start using Glean.
Library code should never call `Glean.initialize`, since it should be called exactly once per application.


```python
from glean import Glean

Glean.initialize(
    application_id="my-app-id",
    application_version="0.1.0",
    upload_enabled=True,
)
```

Once initialized, if `upload_enabled` is true, the Glean SDK will automatically start collecting [baseline metrics](pings/metrics.md).
If `upload_enabled` is false, any persisted metrics, events and pings (other than `first_run_date` and `first_run_hour`) are cleared, and subsequent calls to record metrics will be no-ops.

Additional configuration is available on the `glean.Configuration` object, which can be passed into `Glean.initialize()`.

Unlike Android and Swift, the Python bindings do not automatically send any pings.
See the [custom pings documentation](pings/custom.md) about adding custom pings and sending them.

<div data-lang="C#" class="tab">

The main control for the Glean SDK is on the `GleanInstance` singleton.

The Glean SDK should be initialized as soon as possible, and importantly, before any other libraries in the application start using Glean.
Library code should never call `Glean.initialize`, since it should be called exactly once per application.


```C#
using static Mozilla.Glean.Glean;

GleanInstance.Initialize(
    applicationId: "my.app.id",

## Behavior when uninitialized

Metric recording that happens before the Glean SDK is initialized is queued and applied at initialization.
To avoid unbounded memory growth the queue is bounded (currently to a maximum of 100 tasks), and further recordings are dropped.
The number of recordings dropped, if any, is recorded in the `glean.error.preinit_tasks_overflow` metric.

Custom ping submission will not fail before initialization.
Collection and upload of the custom ping is delayed until the Glean SDK is initialized.
Built-in pings are only available after initialization.

## Enabling and disabling metrics

{{#include ../../shared/tab_header.md}}

<div data-lang="Kotlin" class="tab">

`Glean.setUploadEnabled()` should be called in response to the user enabling or disabling telemetry.

**Note**:
If called before `Glean.initialize()` the call to `Glean.setUploadEnabled()` will be ignored.
Set the initial state using `uploadEnabled` on `Glean.initialize()`.

</div>

<div data-lang="Swift" class="tab">

`Glean.shared.setUploadEnabled()` should be called in response to the user enabling or disabling telemetry.

**Note**:
If called before `Glean.shared.initialize()` the call to `Glean.shared.setUploadEnabled()` will be ignored.
Set the initial state using `uploadEnabled` on `Glean.shared.initialize()`.

</div>

<div data-lang="Python" class="tab">

`Glean.set_upload_enabled()` should be called in response to the user enabling or disabling telemetry.

**Note**:
If called before `Glean.initialize()` the call to `Glean.set_upload_enabled()` will be ignored.
Set the initial state using `upload_enabled` on `Glean.initialize()`.

</div>

<div data-lang="C#" class="tab">

`GleanInstance.SetUploadEnabled()` should be called in response to the user enabling or disabling telemetry.

**Note**:
If called before `GleanInstance.initialize()` the call to `GleanInstance.SetUploadEnabled()` will be ignored.
Set the initial state using `uploadEnabled` on `GleanInstance.initialize()`.

</div>

{{#include ../../shared/tab_footer.md}}

The application should provide some form of user interface to call this method.

When going from enabled to disabled, all pending events, metrics and pings are cleared, except for [`first_run_date` and `first_run_hour`](pings/index.html#the-client_info-section).
When re-enabling, core Glean metrics will be recomputed at that time.
