glean.validation:
  app_forceclosed_count:
    type: counter
    description:
      This metric counts how many times a dirty bit was detected when starting
      the Glean SDK, on Android.
      This dirty bit is set to `true` when Android's lifecycle `ON_START` is
      hit and flipped back to false on `ON_STOP`. When an application is
      force-closed, it might not get the `ON_STOP` and so the value would stay
      `true`. The next time Glean starts, it will increment this counter.
