/**
 * This implements the developer facing API for recording text metrics.
 *
 * Instances of this class type are automatically generated by the parsers at build time,
 * allowing developers to record values that were previously registered in the metrics.yaml file.
 *
 * The text API only exposes the [set] method, which takes care of validating the input
 * data and making sure that limits are enforced.
