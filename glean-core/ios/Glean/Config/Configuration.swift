///   * serverEndpoint: A `String` representing the server the pings are sent to.  This should only be changed
///     for tests
///   * userAgent: the user agent used when sending pings, only to be used internally.
///   * connectionTimeout: the timeout, in milliseconds, to use when connecting to the `serverEndpoint`.
///   * readTimeout: the timeout, in milliseconds, to use when connecting to the `serverEndpoint`.
///   * maxEvents: the number of events to store before the events ping is sent.
///   * logPings: whether to log ping contents to the console. This is only meant to be used internally by the
///     `GleanDebugActivity`.
///   * httpClient: The HTTP client implementation to use for uploading pings.
///   * pingTag: String tag to be applied to headers when uploading pings for debug view. This is only meant to
///     be used internally by the `GleanDebugActivity`.
///   * channel: the release channel the application is on, if known. This will be sent along with all the pings,
///     in the `client_info` section.
