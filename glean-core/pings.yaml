baseline:
  description: |
    This ping is intended to provide metrics that are managed by the library
    itself, and not explicitly set by the application or included in the
    application's `metrics.yaml` file.
    The `baseline` ping is automatically sent when the application is moved to
    the background.

  reasons:
    dirty_startup: |
      The ping was submitted at startup, because the application process was
      killed before the Glean SDK had the chance to generate this ping, before
      becoming inactive, in the last session.

      *Note*: this ping will not contain the `glean.baseline.duration` metric.
    inactive: |
      The ping was submitted when becoming inactive. In earlier versions, this
      was called `background`.
    active: |
      The ping was submitted when the application became active again, which
      includes when the application starts. In earlier versions, this was called
      `foreground`.

      *Note*: this ping will not contain the `glean.baseline.duration` metric.

metrics:
  description: |
    The `metrics` ping is intended for all of the metrics that are explicitly
    set by the application or are included in the application's `metrics.yaml`
    file (except events).
    The reported data is tied to the ping's *measurement window*, which is the
    time between the collection of two `metrics` ping. Ideally, this window is
    expected to be about 24 hours, given that the collection is scheduled daily
    at 4AM. Data in the `ping_info` section of the ping can be used to infer the
    length of this window.

  reasons:
    overdue: |
      The last ping wasn't submitted on the current calendar day, but it's after
      4am, so this ping submitted immediately
    today: |
      The last ping wasn't submitted on the current calendar day, but it is
      still before 4am, so schedule to send this ping on the current calendar
      day at 4am.
    tomorrow: |
      The last ping was already submitted on the current calendar day, so
      schedule this ping for the next calendar day at 4am.
    upgrade: |
      This ping was submitted at startup because the application was just
      upgraded.
    reschedule: |
      A ping was just submitted. This ping was rescheduled for the next calendar
      day at 4am.

events:
  description: |
    The events ping's purpose is to transport all of the event metric
    information. The `events` ping is automatically sent when the application
    becomes inactive.

  notification_emails:
    - glean-team@mozilla.com
  reasons:
    startup: |
      The ping was submitted at startup. The events ping is always sent if there
      are any pending events at startup, because event timestamps can not be
      mixed across runs of the application.
    inactive: |
      The ping was submitted when becoming inactive. In earlier versions, this
      was called `background`.
    max_capacity: |
      The maximum number of events was reached (default 500 events).

deletion-request:
  description: |
    This ping is submitted when a user opts out of
    sending technical and interaction data to Mozilla.
    This ping is intended to communicate to the Data Pipeline
    that the user wishes to have their reported Telemetry data deleted.
    As such it attempts to send itself at the moment the user
    opts out of data collection.
